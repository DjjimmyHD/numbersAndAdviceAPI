# MOAR API

Using the links below create an app that displays the fatcs and advice you want. You can also use bootswatch and bootstrap (or any other CSS framework you choose) to make the app clean and presntable in the 45 minutes you have to work with. I have created a example.js to help _only_ if you get stuck. Use it as a last resort or a starting point. Be warned if you copy my code over entirely, it has bugs that prevent it from running. If you get stuck ask a neighbor and remember to try your best. ðŸ˜˜
